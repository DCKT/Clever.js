## A clever Node.js web framework

The main purpose of this framework is **Convention Over Configuration**, it's inspired from Ember.js or Ruby On Rails. It follows the
MVC design pattern.

**No more dependencies**
I don't like projects with thousand dependencies, that's why Smart doesn't use another library except the Node.js API.
All is based on the http module, no express or connect here.

## Structure
Your application must follow some convention for working correctly. Here is how you should present your folder / files :

![Structure of an application](https://github.com/DCKT/Smart.js/blob/master/doc/structure.png)

## Concepts
You can create somes routes, each routes own a controller and a view associated, a route named __hello__ will looking for a hello file in
the **controllers** folder and hello.html in views folder.

**Index or '/'**
Because every application have an index page, you must not create an index controller execpt if you realy need to perform some actions.


### Setup
`npm install -g smartjs`

With this package come a command line named `smart`.

Here is a basic server configuration :
```javascript
var http = require('http'),
Smart    = require('smartjs');

Smart.Router.map("/hello");

http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  Smart.Router.manage(req, res);
}).listen(3000);

console.log("Server launched on localhost:3000 ...");
```

### Command line API

`smart new **[name]**`

Generate an empty project with an index.html and server.js files.


### General API

**Smart.Router**
Router is an object who will register and manage your routes.

  **Router.map([string list])**
  
  You will pass here all of your routes. You can create nested routes like /posts/new, the controller will be named **PostsNew**

  **Router.manage(request, response)**
  This method will use the request and response object given by the http module.

**Smart.Controller**

Controller is an object who will be used to deserved your data to your view.
